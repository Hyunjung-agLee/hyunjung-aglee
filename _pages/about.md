I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis working in Agricultural and Behavioral Economics. I am actively seeking academic positions for the 2025–26 academic year.

My dissertation work explores how consumers interpret and evaluate various food labels and claims and process label- and production-related information, particularly in the context of sustainable farming practices. I also study how consumers evaluate product quality when multiple, potentially redundant labels and claims are used to promote credence qualities. Across all studies, I emphasize consumers’ subjective information processing, which may lead to different outcomes than those predicted by traditional economic theory.

Before joining UC Davis, I worked as a researcher at the Korea Rural Economic Institute. I earned both my B.A. and M.A. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from Seoul National University.
