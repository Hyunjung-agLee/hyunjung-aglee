I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis. I am actively seeking academic positions for the 2025â€“26 academic year.

Before joining UC Davis, I was a researcher at the Korea Rural Economic Institute. I earned both my B.A. and M.A. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from Seoul National University.

You can reach me at **hjhlee@ucdavis.edu**.
